        <h2>What is Postpartum Depression?</h2>
        <p>Postpartum depression (PPD) is a mood disorder that can affect women after childbirth. It's characterized by feelings of sadness, anxiety, and exhaustion that can make it difficult for mothers to care for themselves and their babies. PPD is different from the "baby blues," which are mild, short-term symptoms of depression and anxiety that many women experience after giving birth.</p>
        <h2>Symptoms of Postpartum Depression</h2>
        <p>Some common symptoms of PPD include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Feeling sad or depressed most of the day</li>

            <li>Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much</li>
            <li>Lack of energy or motivation</li>
            <li>Feeling worthless or guilty</li>
